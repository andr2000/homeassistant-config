# Enable logging
logger:

# - Blink slowly (about every second) when a warning is active.
#   Warnings are active when for example reading a sensor value
#   fails temporarily or the WiFi/MQTT connections are disrupted.
# - Blink quickly (multiple times per second) when an error is active.
#   Errors indicate that ESPHome has found an error while setting up.
#   In most cases, ESPHome will still try to recover from the error
#   and continue with all other operations.
# - Stay off otherwise.
